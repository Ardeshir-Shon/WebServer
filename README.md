# WebServer

This is a simple web server created to serve html files using some reflection technuiqes in Java.

Put code base(website root) on the home_directory for serving by this web seever on localhost port .

TODO:
  - Add configuration file structure for more flexibility in configuration.(I mean something like nginx.conf)
  - Add compatibility with common programming languages for integrability to build codes to HTML. 
  - Give a name for this simple web server!
